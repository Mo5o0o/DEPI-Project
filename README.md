# Sales Forecasting and Optimization

This project aims to forecast future sales using historical data to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

## 📊 Objectives
- Perform EDA to identify patterns and seasonality.
- Build and evaluate time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, XGBoost, Prophet, etc).
- Deploy the best-performing model using Streamlit or Flask.
